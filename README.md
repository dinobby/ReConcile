# Installation
This project is tested on Python 3.10.11. All dependencies can be installed via:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Run
First, you will need the following keys in your ```.env``` file:

```
OPEN_AI_API_BASE = "..."
OPEN_AI_API_VERSION = "..." 
OPEN_AI_API_KEY = "..."
PALM_API_KEY = "..."
CLAUDE_COOCKIE1 = "..."
CLAUDE_COOCKIE2 = "..."
CLAUDE_COOCKIE3 = "..."
CLAUDE_COOCKIE4 = "..."
CLAUDE_COOCKIE5 = "..."
```

We use [Claude-API](https://github.com/KoushikNavuluri/Claude-API) to get results from Claude. For more details about cookies, please refer to [Claude-API](https://github.com/KoushikNavuluri/Claude-API).

If you use more than five accounts for Claude, you can put more in ```.env```

Just remember to edit ```claude_coockies``` in ```generation.py```

Next, run the following command to start:

```
python run.py --num_samples 100 --dataset SQA
````

Currently, dataset can be ```["SQA", "GSM8k", "ECQA", "Aqua"]``` 

# Dataset
